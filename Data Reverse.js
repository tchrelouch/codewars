/*
A stream of data is received and needs to be reversed.

Each segment is 8 bits long, meaning the order of these segments needs to be reversed, for example:

11111111  00000000  00001111  10101010
 (byte1)   (byte2)   (byte3)   (byte4)
should become:

10101010  00001111  00000000  11111111
 (byte4)   (byte3)   (byte2)   (byte1)
The total number of bits will always be a multiple of 8.

The data is given in an array as such:

[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]
*/
function dataReverse(data) {
  let initial = [];
  while(data.length>0){
    initial.push(data.slice(-8));
    data = data.slice(0,data.length-8);
  }
  return initial.flat();
}
